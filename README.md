# Mock-Up of a Ticket Purchasing Page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You will need Node installed in order to run this. I used the Node v18.13.0 installation.

## Once Prerequisites are Installed

I believe you should be able to navigate into the directory this repo is cloned to, and run `npm install` to download all dependencies.  In case anything is still missing, the only things other than the basic `npx create-react-app my-app` command that I've run was `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled` to install the materials library I used in creating this. 

If you successully run npm install in the correct directory, then you should be able to proceed (still in the same cloned repo directory)...

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. (Although it should auto-open a window without you needing to manually navigate)
